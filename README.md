Simple command line tool for generating ASN Block lists and DNS Server entry for Android AFWall.


It generates AFWall scripts for blocking connections to google, facebook, whatever you want.
This gets achieved through setting the corressponding iptables rules.



*Open a terminal window
*git clone https://github.com/mglinux/afwall_easy.git
*cd afwall_easy
*Make the script executable with "chmod +x afwall.sh"
*Run the script with ./afwall.sh


Set the DNS proxy to -Disable DNS via netd- (preferences->Binaries->DNS proxy)
You must allow (Android 5+) -[0] (root) - Apps running as root- in afwall else dns resolving wonÂ´t work!


Maybe not all IPs get banned through the ASN block, but at least it's a beginning :-)


Thx ukanth, Mike and maloe for all your hard work!
