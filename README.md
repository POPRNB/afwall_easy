# afwall_easy
Bash script for generating ASN Block lists and setting DNS Server for Android AFWall


Python2 is required


Start the script from terminal with ./afwall.sh


Maybe not all IPs get banned through the ASN block, but at least it's a beginning :-)


Thx ukanth and Mike for all your hard work!
