# afwall_easy
Bash script for generating ASN Block lists and setting DNS Server for Android AFWall
https://github.com/mglinux/afwall_easy


Python2 and python2-ipaddress are required! 


*Extract afwall_easy.zip
*Open a terminal window
*Make the script executable with "chmod +x afwall.sh"
*Run the script with ./afwall.sh


Maybe not all IPs get banned through the ASN block, but at least it's a beginning :-)


Thx ukanth and Mike for all your hard work!
